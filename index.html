    <h3 class="hop">Why i'm here.</h3>
    <p>
      I chose to attend this class because multiple of my friends
      have wanted to design and or create videogames. I myself am not very
      interested in computer codding programing or any other sort of technology
      heavy careers, but to be a support to any dreams or goals my friends have
      I chose to take this course to be a helping hand to them. I will still
      strive to do my best in this course as well as doing my best to be usefull
      to both you as the teacher-aka listening- and useful to those im seated
      by.
    </p>
    <h3 class="hop">Some more stuff about me.</h3>
    <p>
      Im currently trying to be the best version of
      myself actively going to the gym and reading among other things. Im a very
      goal driven person so created lists and "goals" that keep me focused. I always
      strive to be a better person each and every day so know Im really trying.
      I take pride in my beliefs and determination to keep moving forward. I see in very black and white so I either care to little or to much so
      just a warning about that. Thats all I can really muster up about myself
      at the moment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="hop">This is a list of my favourite hobbies, interests and things in this
      universe</h3>
